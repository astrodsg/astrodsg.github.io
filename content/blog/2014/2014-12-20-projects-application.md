summary: Projects is an application which oversees documents you've created and allows you to comment on them - so you can remind your later self what the hell you were doing. It has great timeline views which allow you to see your progress and quickly accesses past material. What's more, it even allows you to take snapshots of folders to manually version control yourself.


[Projects](https://projects.ac/features) - This assists you in organizing files. Keeps track of data, code, analysis, etc. Costs ~$30. I've only experimented with the trial version.

# Keeping Your Projects Organized

I've had several conversations about the best way to organize files for a project. This is definitely a project dependent question and in the general sense it depends on the inputs, processing, and outputs you expect. Most of the time this is up to you to make sure you name files, put them in logical places, and keep your own metadata so later you can figure out what you were trying to do.

The conversations generally branch into "is there any tool which can help me with this?"

I was inspired to do some deep digging for such a tool which eventually led me to find...Projects

# Projects: The Application You've Been Looking For

This application is a dream for keeping track of your projects. 

Currently it's Mac OSX only, sorry Linux users (and Windows users, just why? haha). Projects impliments the very best of Mac for beautiful applications.

It's name is terrible. Try internet searching "Projects" and even with added keywords it'll take you a long time to find it. 





## Not too deep, not too shallow

One idea is not to have file structures too shallow, i.e. one directory with __ALL__ your files. Also you want to avoid structures which are too deep, i.e. several directories to get to the file you want. A rule of thumb is once you have >10 files, think about making a new directory.

For my astronomy research I adopted this scheme for each project I worked on:

Project Name/Analysis
            /Data
            /Docs
            /Code
