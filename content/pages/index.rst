Welcome to my site
##################

Isn't the internet amazing! This part is just about me. I currently work at the `University of Utah's Department of Physics and Astronomy <http://www.astro.utah.edu>`_ as post-baccalaureate research assistant. Basically, I study stars. Check out my `research page </research.html>`_ for more. This requires programming and data analysis knowledge. I'm hoping to apply this knowledge in my next job. If you are hiring programmers/data analysts/etc please `contact me </contact.html>`_. Cheers!
