### Things I did: ###

* __[dsgSPECTRE](https://github.com/astrodsg/dsgSPECTRE")__ A tool for measuring equivalent widths and doing manipulations to spectra. Originally written by Chris Sneden, I have made enhancements to make the code more efficient for the user.
* __[Astro Junior Researcher Meetings](https://github.com/AstroJuniorResearcherMeetings)__ The resources for a series of discussion sessions I and Tim Anderton lead for students just getting involved in research.
* __[latbin](https://github.com/astrodsg/latbin)__ Python package for binning large data into managable sizes for analysis
