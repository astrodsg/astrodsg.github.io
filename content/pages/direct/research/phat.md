The
[Panchromatic Andromeda Treasury Survey](http://www.astro.washington.edu/groups/phat/Home.html) (PHAT; Dalcanton+ 2012) contains
over 117 million individual star observations. Each star has six filter photometry covering the ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. The survey covers a third of Andromeda's disk within 20 kpc. This data set is incredibly rich and allows unprecedented detail for studying galaxy structure.  


My research with [Anil Seth](http://www.physics.utah.edu/~aseth/Anil_Seth.html) uses bright red giant branch (RGB) stars to explore Andromeda's metallicity morphology. The metallicity quantifies the overall chemical enrichment. Looking at how the metals are distributed, and including other information about the galaxy's structure, we can infer how the galaxy has evolved over time.
