Galaxies like the Milky Way form in part from canabalizing smaller stellar systems
like dwarf galaxies. Disentagling the origins of stars found in the Milky Way
today can be complicated. Dynamical and chemical properties of the stars
aid in this.

<p>
  Working with Inese Ivans at the University of Utah I investigated
  two moving groups of ~6 stars each which had similar orbital energy, orbital angular momentum,
  and over-all chemcial enrichment. The dyanmical properties of these groups
  suggested that they may have extra-galactic origins. From the high-resolution
  I used tools such as IRAF, dsgSPECTRE, and MOOG to extract the chemical abundances
  of alpha-elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) from the spectra. These elements trace
  the star formation rate of the progrenitor environment, providing another 
  handle on the extra-galactic nature of these stars.
