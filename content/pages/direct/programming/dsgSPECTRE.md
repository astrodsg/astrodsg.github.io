Spectre was originally written by Michael Fitzpatrick and Chris Sneden 
for doing analysis on high-resolution spectra. When I began working
on high-resolution spectra of my own I inherited this code from my
advisor Inese Ivans. Recognizing areas of improvement I dove into the 
f77 code and re-wrote portions to have desired functionallity. 

[The code is available on github](https://github.com/astrodsg/dsgSPECTRE)
