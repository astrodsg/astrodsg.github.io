Tim Anderton and I developed latbin because when we went looking for
a general python binning code we found none. We drew on knowledge 
from mathematics for lattices useful for getting the tightest packing
or thinest covering for different dimensions. 

The code is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/latbin")
and includes documenation with examples. <br>
If you have the python package installer `pip` then 
you can run `pip install latbin` on the command line.
