Astropy is currently being deveoped by the astronomy community to 
be a single core package for Astronomy and bring together other
affiliated astronomy packages. This effort is important for astronomy
which has many large data sets growing at an expoential rate. With 
so much data needing to be analyzed quailty programs are essential. 
I am not a core contributor but am greatful for the code and add
to it's growth when I can.              

The code is available using `pip` and on [github](https://www.github/astropy/astropy)
