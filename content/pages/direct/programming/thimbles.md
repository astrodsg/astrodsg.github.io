THIMBLES is a python package which was developed by Tim Anderton, 
Brian Kimmig, and myself for extracting information for large
ensambles of spectra. Specifically, this code is targeted at 
extracting chemical abundances though it is more powerful. This code
handles the modeling of many spectra simultaniously and allows
you to analyze more information about the spectra than simply
just the extracted abundances. This ability gives more power for
finding groups and trends from your spectra.

Many spectra analysis black boxes do poor approximations and 
ofen handle the spectra in unpredictable ways. THIMBLES is designed
with sophisitcated algorithms and with paradigm that any work by
the code should be easily varified and modified by a researcher. We've
built a GUI as part of THIMBLES which allows the user to interact
with the spectra and spectral models to assist the code in deriving
fundamental parameters.  

THIMBLES is being developed as part of Inese Ivans'
cosmic origins and stellar populations research group at the 
University of Utah. This code is currently not publically available.
